                                    <p>Hello there!</p>
                                    <p>My name is Patrick. I go by WalrusDog as my sort of brand and online handle. I am a creator, developer and artist.</p>
                                    <p>I graduated from Mississippi Coding Academies in 2022 and hold a passion for web development/design, game design and art. I find I am better at creative things, but Iâ€™m not afraid to tackle something more technical. I am of the belief that anyone can learn anything and take that seriously when presented with challenges.</p>
                                    <p>Everything you see on this page as far as art was made by me! I have been learning digital painting and digital design so that I can make my own art and assets for my games.</p>
                                    <p>I am in the process of making my first full video game, check back here, on the game specific website, or my twitter for updates!</p>
                                    <p>If you would like more information, please send me an email, or message on social media. Hope we can make something cool together! </p>
                                </p>
